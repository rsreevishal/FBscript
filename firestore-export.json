Based on the position, facial expressions and speech provided by the driver the system operates in three modes. Mode 1 is Emergency Mode in which the automobile is driven at high speed\r\n\r\nPROJECT IDEA: The Image Processing and Speech Processing is one of the most common uses of machine learning where you can classify the object as a digital image. There are many situations where you can classify the object as a digital image. Based upon the image processing the driving system in automobiles can be configured that is the facial recognition of the driver and the position of the driver can be captured through the camera. Through the speech of the driver the driving mode of the system is configured, to that particular mode which is installed in the system. This system is constructed with the audio system along with the video system. So, in case of the emergency purpose most of them want to drive at a high speed, at that time they don’t need to activate the audio system. In case of happy mode, the system just adapts to that mode which makes to plays the song in the playlist which you have played in the happy mode. In case of alone mode, we need to make feel as a alone, Just think of someone travelling along with you, so songs will be updated in your driver \r\n\r\n\r\n","name3":"J.

The farmers face a lot of problems in the field, in which water resources and power supply are the main problems. The project is designed to reduce the effect of these important problems of depletion of water resources by optimizing the water consumption used for irrigation and regulate the power supply for the process to continue regularly.Internet of Things is a technological aspect that is growing huge in recent times and hence coupling is done to agriculture. A PV module is used in this project for using sunlight as the power source so that it gets a very good yield of the farm, especially in the summer season. The proposed system has an eye on the moisture content of the soil by moisture sensors and  DHT11 sensors for measuring humidity and temperature. This is done by a Bot, that moves on the agricultural field,  which senses the level of moisture by moving in a particular distance at a particular time that is set by the user. According to the level of moisture, the pumps are switched ON or OFF that provide water automatically using a microcontroller and 'Adafruit' server. The main aim of using IoT in the future where machines and robots are automated in all forms of fields. IoT ensures the user to control and monitor the scenario of the field. This proposed system is thus devised to solve the different problems faced by agriculture.","name3":"E Vedhanarayanan","mobile4":"8610114928"},"KSme5i5dQmUplr7xFVY8pHP9rWq2":{"year3":"1","department4":"cse","department2":"cse","college4":"","mobile3":"9790437923","name":"Saranya K","year4":"1","team_no":"4","college3":"","abstract":"Intelligent traffic signal controlling in jam-packed traffic conditions for emergency vehicles using NodeMCU.With increased number of vehicles on the road, traffic congestion and transportation delays are increasing worldwide.

Until now, Avasaram 108 app was only able to detect the location of the caller. Although launched in 2017, less than 5% of the calls the call centre receives are from this app. Most people did not download the app as they had very little information through it. According to the performance data of the emergency service, only two out of every five calls the call centre in Teynampet receives is for a medical emergency. Out of these calls, nearly one in five is a repeat call to ask the control room if help was on the way or how long it will take for help to arrive. Letting people track the ambulance that has been assigned to them will help them keep calm. It will also reduce the number of repeat calls the centre receives.so to overcome this we have come up with a solution of a an mobile application thorough which people can easily book a nearby ambulance and also lively track the ambulance. This will reduce the time for the ambulance to reach the destination. Also during major accidents one ambulance driver can give a major accident alert to the nearby ambulances in order to save lives.","name3":"BARATHRAJKUMARAN V","mobile4":"9952023334","name4":"AJAY KRISHNAN","driver_link":"","email4":"ajaykrishnan.s.2018.cse@rajala","mobile2":" 9551574355","email":"bharatvarshan.cse@gmail.com","college":"RAJALAKSHMI ENGNEERING COLLEGE","mobile":"9703681102","email3":"barathrajkumaran.v.2018.cse@ra","department3":"cse","year2":"2","college2":"RAJALAKSHMI ENGNEERING COLLEGE","team_name":"INITIATORS","year":"2","g-recaptcha-response":"03AERD8Xo3aNuugq3fAZx-d-Zeyg2cqwieNiIh7A9N7JTfNQNvB-DF8Y8rw4G1PRepTpxvTNtRFlrmoOJg4uZtw-__POnqbmkg1myFFTcwTYCLwM7H5UOmjWrJrg0rex1SW7fKMZDjQRGa27ez3cDDt9t1Dv_8lqit34ISxEmj7v7r7OMM6za5bGz1lyPcWLu7h091Bxt49hopEIXw69ae0QAfeHXooRhfD4FUnWfWwC-y57byDxBs88qGby1vq54EOCx3eGtAYs83PHdObArjj7g4ZI0NmRG5IKxSaYVgncDQCrsUETfcNaFYtYxFHhoIqVzeV2PpJqP5MU7x12lKqfeidQ3mFmwF145xtAYGM5IPKo4fC1svY043ySMTJzKQ6_AaBcIZwQm8Y8CafadkfZjNRIJb4g8VbA","domain":"health","email2":"2017ashwin@gmail.com","department":"cse","name2":"ASHWIN R","year3":"2","department4":"cse","department2":"cse","college4":"RAJALAKSHMI ENGNEERING COLLEGE","mobile3":"9840176511","name":"BHARAT VARSHAN S M","year4":"2","team_no":"4"},"LuqqeqF7E1h3A39VAhsbVg07a9o2":{"mobile4":"","name4":"","driver_link":"","email4":"","mobile2":"9840114206","email":"rjayvarshinee@gmail.com","college":"Sri Venkateswara College Of Engineering","mobile":"9940371324","email3":"jananiiramesh@gmail.com","department3":"cse","year2":"2","college2":"SVCE","team_name":"TRINIQUE","year":"2","g-recaptcha-response":"03AERD8XqFrp51fK7klRTWm1iG8oFZBXm3FdoLAH9C6E_g6k27aVyN3dETOM3pla9QYK_0PvYBCpCW4IiRd-81KTXmgIhG4LEUR6_8sp_uOFEtSU5gPxopxK_K1Wvuk8R65JBC5Y_A6V_65ua4eK3_1yobrGBgLfFU3_eWWEAe7pQgkiHk7HSCOj0Hc5wVCdGytKnJ7ugT22nAg4KNKCiysRZB-AYkDvX67pDKRh0puYdOWwKtppKJRAjQwKCdlSvPsyupTq0iM-7qwdeTBi-OdVYzVe2Xp01Qjjfnt9jrFDB_mEUoFrF34I7IzGJ84xAUtxA74ycsk3mD38NV5EUuziSj__jX5n_oleGWHHy-cR3ay2pK9j68piqYnx1Kb6i0o94XOeuQNWWvnW3LEa_0PiGQB4hu9bK78xbrg9mBNxufECr9PkOrto8","domain":"finance","email2":"divyamuthu2000@gmail.com","department":"cse","name2":"Divya M","year3":"2","department4":"cse","department2":"cse","college4":"","mobile3":"8940056361","name":"Jayvarshinee R","year4":"1","team_no":"3","college3":"SVCE","abstract":"CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION\r\nThis project mainly focuses primarily on credit card fraud detection in real world.

We can also find the nearest ambulance by analyzing the perimeter and route them using the shortest path. This would help in enabling the medical emergency team to act in impulse.","name3":"Kalaiarasi.N","mobile4":"7092777729","name4":"Joann Nittika","driver_link":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TeGvhLUGT2MTzrNvTaO_bz8r6kq1GsJc/view?usp=sharing","email4":"joann29nittika@gmail.com","mobile2":"9790487957","email":"shravanity@gmail.com","college":"Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering","mobile":"9789921546","email3":"kalaisnlpriya@gmail.com","department3":"it","year2":"3","college2":"SVCE","team_name":"Unagi","year":"3","g-recaptcha-response":"03AERD8XoSTLk6w3z-8zd5yeG8C_H8pc9cxh-NlEijm3N3AgA24Qyz7azcsAXjgsKQ7apnToU_pOFhU_CT6tHdC3JDJvbjtsx-XaGOlRe4qCWRbmqFqUJrNLcW26-ardFp2iMROyhgRxhP6NaczaRaYGLuSUh4Sgj-sZLiwrGYOpCKHd9QYzAKuVMlmur1wDYNGIMHMCxSUGRQLecr0uP4tvhWVDhJjLTtNrpscHQiloZCu7vv44k32t8X0_PExxmBvTuLRFqvX5o9tA03gyVV-vLWTSiDZi-2I_SEYEV2m0R01yGLUW4g5aN8UR0YdUYFvhHPtmcoZZsOM6DvoLejX5fiM1eCMT6IdQAIZ4v2B1rPLITr6w69VxWrmF8s-ZIKgnWSJmGXlQql","domain":"STC"},"TAPwCqsEkTRK1DWGDsIosRiXWM03":{"college3":"SVCE","abstract":"Our project is a Practical Problem Generator (PPG). The PPG generates questions that are practical, relevant, and used on a day-to-day basis. It interacts with machines used to solve problems in industries, laboratories, hospitals, etc to find problems that are handled in a real-world environment. It then sends these problems back to teachers in educational institutions to set question papers or teach students. Solving practical problems allows students to understand the applications of their theory concepts and formulae, and provides a whole new dimension of learning. It is always difficult to learn a concept without understanding why you’re learning it, and that’s the problem that the PPG solves.

using Machine Learning\r\nWith the advent of applications to make payments digitally, personal finance management and security have become a major area of concern. Since digital\r\npayments negate the need for currency notes, it has become difficult for people to manage their spending. Studies have shown e-payments induce over spending .\r\nPeople are not able to withdraw and spend cautiously as they would with physical currency.\r\nTo address these problems, we want to develop an application that would give the user suggestions on whether they should spend money on something or not. When a user first registers, their spending habits will be analysed. The user will also be required to enter how much money they want to save in a particular month. With these details, when a user wants to make a purchase at a particular date, the machine learning algorithm will recommend to the user whether he/she will be able to achieve their savings goal at the end of the month. To also serve as a one stop application to manage finances, security features like facial recognition and block\r\nchain practices will also be integrated into the application. For example my monthly salary is Rs 10,000 and I want to save Rs 5000. If I want to buy some new\r\nclothes at a particular time of the month, our algorithm will analyse spending habits and suggest whether it is a smart purchase, and will I still not exceed my\r\nbudget.

Every day, we can able to see somewhere in the corner of the newspapers and Media Headlines that notify the garbage related issues in and around the city. With the rapid increase in population, the issues related to garbage management is increasing day-by-day and it creates unhygienic condition around public places.To avoid this problem, and in concern, with the public health and cleanliness of surroundings we are proposing “Smart Trash Clearance ”. As a recent initiative of the Indian Government, smart cities cannot be complete without the smart garbage waste management system. In the proposed system, garbage dustbins will be issued with an embedded device that helps in real-time monitoring of garbage levels in the dustbins. The data related to garbage level and waste segregation will be traced by the suitable sensors and it will provide an optimized route for garbage vans which tends to reduce the cost associated with fuel. An android application for mobile and web server for municipality use is also made where the status of each dustbin can be checked and verified before the next cleaning process. Therefore, our proposed system intends to execute the smart city initiative effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeywords: Arduino IDE, Android, Ultrasonic Sensor, Wi-Fi Module ESP8266.","name3":"Daicy Rani.P","mobile4":"6382941119","name4":"Hemavarshini.L","driver_link":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JA2WAKfBdfOCejtqO16KWpnXDkcRuaHD/view?usp=drivesdk","email4":"hemavarshini246@gmail.com","mobile2":"6379544624","email":"dhivyadharshini115@gmail.com","college":"Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering","mobile":"8098360265","email3":"daicyrani480@gmail.com","department3":"cse","year2":"2","college2":"Sri Venkateswara College ofEng","team_name":"Bin Wagon","year":"2","g-recaptcha-response":"03AERD8XrMnho812mVZNAR2tmaNgFVwhKf72IL3jTE9ZUVQg60H799hswCvXH-tIjTRsCmTUv8sWy8mBByD-z0Jmmhtnm-c5Re_5S6bcdUrRaKhehUclVXrCVivkJFP7gp6S1kWx5HWo0LqQy7MJbewNRJDZMmLV6UKdVFugQ0BLTDXIL7ZiU4okXe3BZx0S6ZZpn-m5ooTKK6QbxySbK8SOcrjyqRWzGkPbsCoKrIgq0epK18ZkgRazct2dWdIxGmnGlLxndmiJAwL3C778kt_sPeKHyW6d0TO3wrj9BfasyrZ_5xvm2yvBuDzQ5IILEZff0wo3fFELlPqDOCjAsA_vM1MHRt8l9kS_EeD5br56Y1jQREpfIlLrdAHGf3tJeK9M3o5ZVbz0_-vSaPqW9zA2NyLm6CYeRqJ6F_RYf-cYl6TcCAPLMOXdHr89P6FgU3Tn7fny_4aBrcpPquBjWZRZ1rvdWhokfxzA","domain":"eco","email2":"vathishree@gmail.com","department":"cse","name2":"Athishree.V"},"sAw0YI1TuQf8QODhlG00mu2t1sD3":{"mobile3":"7358452910","name":"Jeswin Ebenezer","year4":"1","team_no":"3","college3":"St Joseph's institute of techn","abstract":"The best type of education brought for the students are when we make every students understand a concept.

Colleges update the syllabus to bring qualifiable engineers, but the learning process remains the same way. Students are not understanding the importance of the topics they learn. This creates a gap between skill development and college learning. On the other hand, recruiters are unable to find ideal candidates for their company, as most students are under-skilled or the deciding parameters lag the genuinity factor. Our platform is a virtual learning assistant which aids and guides students to explore, in different perspectives, on the topics they learn in their syllabus. The assistant suggests a road map in which he/she can explore and learn the subjects in the most efficient way. It also credits virtual points for him/her for the interactions, such as blog posts he reads, podcasts he hears, projects he works on and etc. The platform also allows recruiters to hire ideal candidates for their company by the portfolio generated for the works the student does. The generated portfolio portraits the true skills and capabilities of the student, unlike other hiring platforms.","name3":"Lakshay Madhav. M","mobile4":"6383612226","name4":"Nandha Kumar.
